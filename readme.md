Built a website analyzer to extract job search information, with the ability to look through several pages and return company and job details.
I used :
- 'selenium' webdriver to access Chrome browser and navigate website content 
- 'beautifulsoup' to parse through HTML and extract company names, job title, and a job link
- 'streamlit' as the front-end webapp to interact and display scrapped data, and offer Excel file download

*side notes:* <br>
creating separate files/scripts for the 'scraper' and the 'webapp' is called script modularization.
Modular approach enhances:
 - code organization 
 - and maintainability
